# ESM-Typescript-Yarn 3 Skeleton

This repo contains a basic skeleton that attempts to use the current best
practices for a TypeScript pure-ESM project setup. Yarn 3 is used as the package
management system, with
[Zero-Install](https://yarnpkg.com/features/zero-installs) disabled. It is
intended to be the bare minimum to distribute a pure ESM library for Node that
is written in TypeScript and distributed as Javascript.
